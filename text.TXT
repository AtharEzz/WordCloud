he player controls a snowboarder in one of several modes. 1080° has two trick modes (trick attack and contest),
[1] three race modes (race, time attack, and 2 players),
[2] a training mode, and an options mode.
[3] The objective of the game is either to arrive quickly at a level's 
finish line or to receive maximum points for trick combinations.[4]

In 1080°'s two trick modes, trick attack and contest, players 
accrue points from completed tricks.[5] In contest mode, players perform tricks and
 snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players to perform a 
series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 24 tricks and 5 
secret tricks, all of which are performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick,
 the R button, the Z button and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity, combos, 
and required time.[5] The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way,
 or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees.[4] 
The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game.[6]
